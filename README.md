# CubicalMarchingSquares
This is a basic implimentation of the Cubical Marching Squares algorithm. As of yet it lacks any of the adaptive resolution features
described in the original [National Taiwan University paper](https://graphics.cmlab.csie.ntu.edu.tw/CMS/) and the underlying implimentation was designed with feature simplification
in mind rather than the resolution of ambiguous cases. However, that doesn't eliminate the possibility of a future revision with this
feature.
