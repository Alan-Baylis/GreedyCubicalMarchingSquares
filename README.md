# CubicalMarchingSquares
This is a basic implimentation of the Cubical Marching Squares algorithm for use with Unity Engine. It can be used in a project by simply including the namespace and calling the method CMS.ContourMesh with the desired heightmap. As of yet it lacks any of the adaptive resolution features described in the original [National Taiwan University paper](https://graphics.cmlab.csie.ntu.edu.tw/CMS/) and my current goal is to impliment feature simplification rather than selectively increasing resolution to resolve ambiguities. However, that doesn't eliminate the possibility of a future revision with this
feature.
